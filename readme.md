# Lab Report 1 – HTML Tags

Live Link: https://mahmuddevs.github.io/Internet-Programming-Lab-Report-1/

## Project Overview

This project is a basic HTML lab report that demonstrates different types of HTML tags, including:

- **Semantic tags** – tags that provide meaning to content, like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.
- **Non-semantic tags** – tags that are used for layout or styling purposes without providing meaning, like `<div>` and `<span>`.
- **Special / Self-closing tags** – void elements that do not require a closing tag, like `<img>`, `<br>`, `<hr>`, `<input>`, `<meta>`, and `<link>`.
- **Common HTML elements** – headers, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables, forms, audio, video, iframe, buttons, blockquote, horizontal rule, etc.

The project uses **basic CSS styling** to improve readability and demonstrate sections clearly.
